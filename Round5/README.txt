This will be the code debugging competition.

You will be given previously working Data Structers homework, with a single line modified. Your task is to find and fix this line.

No more will be told to you until the competition.

Again, hitting a segfault will add 15 seconds to your time.

(We promise it won't segfault on first compile. <3)
