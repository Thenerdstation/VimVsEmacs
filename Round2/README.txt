Your task is to recreate the file structre in challenge/ into solution/.

You must do this with your text editor of choice and you must type out each folder. Using bash commands or running any command that directly copies from challenge/ will cause you to be disqualified for this round.

There are no files in this file structure, only folders.

Anytime you exit your editor, you will recieve a 15 second penality. We will print out the file structure for you on the day of the competition, so there will be no need to leave your editor.
