Your task is to completely retype the ascii art in challenge.txt.
The output must be exact, any difference when running diff will require you to fix your errors.

Again, no use of bash or copying commands, as this will disqualify you.

This will be the exact art you must copy for the competition, so feel free to memorize it. :)
